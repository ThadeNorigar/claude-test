# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository. Once code is added, this file should be updated with:

- Build, test, and lint commands
- High-level architecture overview
- Key patterns and conventions used in the codebase
- Important dependencies and their purposes

## Next Steps

When initializing this repository, consider documenting:

1. **Development Commands**: How to build, run, test, and lint the code
2. **Architecture**: High-level structure and design patterns
3. **Key Technologies**: Main frameworks, libraries, and tools used
4. **Project-Specific Conventions**: Any unique patterns or practices for this codebase
